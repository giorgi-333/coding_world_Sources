                The story of pizza is a long one. From the Greeks to the Egyptians, from the Persians to the Indians, there have been incarnations of pizza served throughout history. Flatbreads, naan, and plakountos are all early preparations that could be considered cousins to the modern pizza, but there isnâ€™t a consensus as to which is first and whether these could even be considered precursors to pizza at all.
